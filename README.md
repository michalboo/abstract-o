abstract-o
==========

Ugly version of "I'm feeling lucky" for mendeley search with added bells and whistles.

Search for a term in Mendeley, get the title + abstract of the top result read to you in a
language of choice, by google translate's invisible robot.

Mendeley(OAPI) catalog search -> Google Translate -> ? -> Profit

This requires a bunch of ruby gems, and Flash. I'm not sorry.
